My name is Rajat Vadiraj Dwaraknath and I’m currently a PhD student at the [Institute for Computational and Mathematical Engineering (ICME)](https://icme.stanford.edu) at Stanford University. I’ve always been fascinated when seemingly unrelated concepts from different fields and subjects link together to form an insightful explanation of the world around us. The abundance of such conceptual links in fields like mathematics, physics and computer science make them particularly interesting to me. I hope to share some of my stumbling attempts at understanding them in this blog.
